        <h3>Jean-Michel Basquiat, was a Haitian-American artist, musician, and producer from Brooklyn NYC.</h3>

        <p> He first achieved notoriety as part of <b>SAMO,</b> an informal graffiti group who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s where the hip-hop, post-punk and street art movements had coalesced.</p>

          <h2>1984-86</h2>
          <p>Warhol and Basquiat worked on a series of collaborative paintings. Basquiat responded to the abstract, stylized logos with his oppositional graffiti style. Basquiat often painted in expensive <b>Armani</b> suits and would even appear in public in the same paint-splattered clothes.

      <h3 class="text2">When Andy Warhol died on February 22, 1987, Basquiat became increasingly isolated, and his heroin addiction and depression grew more severe. Despite an attempt at sobriety during a trip to Maui, Hawaii, he died on August 12, 1988, of a heroin overdose at his art studio on Great Jones Street in Manhattan's NoHo neighborhood. He was 27.</h3>
